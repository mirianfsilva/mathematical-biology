## Mathematical Biology

Mathematical models in population biology. Repo for my _Population Dynamics_ college assignment. 

Population dynamics is the branch of life sciences that studies the size and age composition of populations as dynamical systems, and the biological and environmental processes driving them (such as birth and death rates, and by immigration and emigration). 

In the applications of population dynamics in biomathematics we will use as differential technical tools the ODE's (Ordinary differential equation), with some extensions that use PDE's (partial differential equation), the finite differential equations and the linear algebra methods.
